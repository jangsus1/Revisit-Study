# About Correlation
- Please read carefully since there will be attention check questions based on this content.

## 1. What Is a correlation?

Correlation shows how two things (variables) move in relation to each other.  
The _correlation coefficient_ (\(r\)) in our experiment will run from 0 to +1. 

**Correlation is not about steepness, it's about strength of tendency.**

**- Positive Correlation**: When one variable goes up, the other goes up too.  
  _Example 1:_ Height and weight often correlate strongly (r = 0.9).  
  _Example 2:_ Height and Intelligence have alomost no correlation (r = 0)

## 2. How Strong Is the Correlation?
The closer r is to 1, the stronger the relationship.

r = 0.9 (very strong)    vs.    r = 0.1 (very weak)
