# Instructions

## Overview

In this experiment, you will see the scatterplot with two variables. Each scatterplot contains 20 data points.
There are total **12** tasks to solve.


## How It Works

### Step 1: **Explore the Scatterplot with your mouse**  
   - A **blank** scatterplot appears.  
   - First *click* on the screen and **move your mouse** to reveal part of the chart for **10** seconds.
   - Try to estimate the correlation while exploring.  
   - The x and y variable that represents the labels will be shown after **5** seconds.

### Step 2: **Predict the Correlation**  
   - Estimate the correlation (**-1.0 to +1.0**).  

### Step 3: **Mark Your Belief**  
   - Rate your belief about the scatterplot using a **Likert scale slider**.
