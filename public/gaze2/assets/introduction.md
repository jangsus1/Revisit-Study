# Understanding Correlation

## 1. What Is Correlation?
Correlation shows how two things (variables) move in relation to each other.  
The _correlation coefficient_ (\(r\)) runs from -1 to +1.

**- Positive Correlation** (\(r > 0\)): When one variable goes up, the other goes up too.  
  _Example:_ Height and weight often correlate strongly (\(r = 0.9\)).
  
**- Negative Correlation** (\(r < 0\)): When one variable goes up, the other goes down.  
  _Example:_ Arctic temperature and amount of ice (\(r = -0.9\)).

## 2. How Strong Is the Correlation?
The closer \(|r|\) is to 1, the stronger the relationship.

r = 0.9 (very strong)    vs.    r = 0.1 (very weak)  
r = -0.9 (very strong)   vs.    r = -0.1 (very weak)
