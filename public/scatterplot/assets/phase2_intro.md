# Task 2 - Instructions

In this experiment, you will see the scatterplot with two real-world variables. The labels could be revealed instantly, few seconds later, or never.  

There are total **12** tasks to solve.

## How It Works

### Step 1: **Explore the scatterplot**  
   - Click to start
   - A scatterplot will be shown for **5 seconds**.
   - Observe the pattern and relationship between the points.
   - **The labels will be randomly shown after a delay.**

### Step 2: **Predict the Correlation**  
   - After viewing the scatterplot, estimate the correlation (**0 to 1**).
