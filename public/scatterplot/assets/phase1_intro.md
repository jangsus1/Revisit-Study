# Task 2 - Instructions

You'll estimate the **correlation coefficient (r-value)** of **12** scatterplots by briefly viewing them and making a judgment.
Try to **calibrate** your guesses during trials to be more accurate.

## How It Works

### Step 1: **View the Scatterplot**
- Click to start
- A scatterplot will be shown for **5 seconds**.
- Observe the pattern and relationship between the points.

### Step 2: **Make a Judgment**
- After 5 seconds, the scatterplot disappears.
- Use a **slider (0 to 1)** to estimate the correlation:
  - **0.0** → No Correlation
  - **1.0** → Strong Correlation

### Step 3: **Feedback & Calibration**
- You'll receive **immediate feedback** showing your response and the actual correlation.
- **Calbrate** your prediction based on the feedback.
- You should wait for a few seconds to move on.
