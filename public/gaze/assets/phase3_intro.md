# Instructions

## Overview

In this experiment, you will assess the relationship between two variables by recalling and recreating a scatterplot from memory.
There are total **12** tasks to solve.

## How It Works

### Step 1: **Mark Your Memory Confidence**  
   - Use a **slider** to indicate how well you remember the scatterplot.  

### Step 2: **Recreate the Scatterplot**  
   - Use your mouse to  **click** and place **20 points** on the scatterplot as you remember them.  

### Step 3: **Report the Correlation**  
   - Estimate the correlation of the scatterplot you recalled (**-1.0 to +1.0**).
