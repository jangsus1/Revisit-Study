# Instructions

## Overview

In this experiment, you will see the scatterplot with two variables. Each scatterplot contains 20 data points.
There are total **16** tasks to solve.


## How It Works

### Step 1: **Mark Your Belief**  
   - Read a statement and rate your belief using a **Likert scale slider**.  

### Step 2: **Predict the Correlation**  
   - Before seeing the scatterplot, estimate the correlation (**-1.0 to +1.0**).  

### Step 3: **Explore the Scatterplot**  
   - A **blurred scatterplot** appears.  
   - Click and drag to reveal part of the data.
   - Try to memorize the correlation.  

### Step 4: **Make a Final Estimate**  
   - Adjust your correlation estimate based on the revealed scatterplot.
