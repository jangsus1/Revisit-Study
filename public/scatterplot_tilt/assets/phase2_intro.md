# Task 3 - Instructions

In this final experiment, you will see the scatterplot with two **real-world variables**.

There are total **12** tasks to solve followed by 2 example tasks.

## How It Works

### Step 1: **Explore the scatterplot**  
   - Click to start
   - A scatterplot will be shown for **2.5 seconds**.
   - Observe the pattern and relationship between the points.
   - The labels will be **Hidden** or **Revealed**

### Step 2: **Estimate the Correlation / Adjust your estimation**  
   - After viewing the scatterplot, estimate the correlation with slider (**0 to 1**).  
   - You may also adjust your estimation with the slider.

### Step 1 and Step 2 will be repeated for a few times.
