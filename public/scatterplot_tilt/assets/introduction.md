## 1. What Is Correlation?
Correlation measures the relationship between two variables. In this experiment, the **correlation coefficient (r)** will range from **0 to +1**.

* **Positive Correlation:** When one variable increases, the other increases as well.
* **The Scale:**
    * r = 1.0: **Perfect relationship** (points form a straight line).
    * r = 0.0: **No relationship** (points are randomly scattered).

## 2. Strength vs. Steepness
**Crucial Distinction:** Correlation measures the **"tightness"** of the data points, not the angle of the line.

* **It is NOT about Steepness:** A steep line and a flat line can have the exact same correlation.
* **It IS about Clustering:** The closer the dots cluster together into a straight line, the higher the correlation.

## 3. Real-World Examples
* **Strong Correlation (r is around 0.9):** Height vs. Weight (Taller people tend to be heavier).
* **No Correlation (r is around 0.0):** Height vs. Intelligence (Height does not predict intelligence).
