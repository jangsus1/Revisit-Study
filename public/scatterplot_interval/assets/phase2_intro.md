# Task 3 - Instructions

In this final experiment, you will see the scatterplot with two **real-world variables**. The labels will be shown instantly, few seconds later, or never.  

There are total **24** tasks to solve after 2 example tasks.

## How It Works

### Step 1: **Explore the scatterplot**  
   - Click to start
   - A scatterplot will be shown for **5 seconds**.
   - Observe the pattern and relationship between the points.
   - **The labels will be shown either instantly, few seconds later, or never.**

### Step 2: **Estimate the Correlation**  
   - After viewing the scatterplot, estimate the correlation with slider (**0 to 1**).
