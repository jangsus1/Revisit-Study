## How It Works

### Step 1: **View the Scatterplot**
- A scatterplot will be shown for **5 seconds**.
- Observe the pattern and relationship between the points.

### Step 2: **Make a Judgment**
- After 5 seconds, the scatterplot disappears.
- Use a **slider (-1.0 to +1.0)** to estimate the correlation:
  - **-1.0** → Strong Negative Correlation
  - **0.0** → No Correlation
  - **+1.0** → Strong Positive Correlation

### Step 3: **Feedback**
- You'll receive **immediate feedback** showing:
  - Your response.
  - The actual correlation value.
- **Adjust your perception based on the feedback!**

### **Caution:**
- **Try to guess the correlation as precise as you can as it works as an attention check.**
