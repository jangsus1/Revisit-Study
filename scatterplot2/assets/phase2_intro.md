# Task 3 - Instructions

In this final experiment, you will see the scatterplot with two **real-world variables**. The labels will be shown instantly, few seconds later, or never.  

There are total **12** tasks to solve after 2 example tasks.

## How It Works

### Step 1: **Explore the scatterplot**  
   - Click to start
   - A scatterplot will be shown for **2.5 seconds**.
   - Observe the pattern and relationship between the points.
   - The labels will be **hidden**

### Step 2: **Estimate the Correlation**  
   - After viewing the scatterplot, estimate the correlation with slider (**0 to 1**).  

### Step 3: **Explore the scatterplot again**
   - Click to start
   - The scatterplot will be shown again for **2.5 seconds**.
   - Observe the pattern and relationship between the points.
   - The labels will be **shown** this time

### Step 4: **Adjust the Estimation**  
   - After viewing the scatterplot, adjust your estimation of the corrlation value with slider (**0 to 1**).
